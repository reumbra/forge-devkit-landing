# /dev — Feature Development

Start developing a feature, bug fix, or refactoring task.

1. Load the `dev` skill — it contains the full pipeline
2. Parse task from arguments: {{ arguments }}
3. Execute the pipeline from Phase 0 through Phase 4
4. If task is linked to a GitHub issue: update issue status after completion
